An alternate ruleset to the oracle class of Pathfinder 2nd edition.

# General Overview

The Mysterious & Revelatory Oracle, or MROracle (pronounced "more-acle"), unites elements of 1st and 2nd edition (both pre-remaster 
and remaster) oracles into a new and exciting ruleset! Please download the complete rules for free at https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/493065/pf2e-mysterious-revelatory-oracle-mroracle.

## Features

The module is designed to make the MROracle ruleset as automated as possible, from character creation all the way
to aura effects. To achieve that, this module includes:
- All 10 mysteries from pre-remaster 2nd edition, reconfigured to the rule changes of the MROracle. Blight mystery added as of 27 Nov 2024.
- 9 brand new revelation subclasses
- Oracle multiclass dedication
- 48 oracle class feats
- Dozens of unique abilities and effects

# Installation

Simply download the manifest from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GwirTheGarish/PF2e-MROracle/main/module.json.

Once installed to Foundry VTT, the module is fully functional. However, the feats will not populate in the character builder without additional setup.
Please follow these simple steps to enable that feature. *You'll also need to repeat this process each time the Pathfinder game system is updated.*

1. Unlock the MROracle compendium and the Feats compendium located in the Character Builder folder.
2. Drag the Feats _folder_ from the MROracle compendium into the Feats compendium you just unlocked.
3. Lock both compendia back.
4. Restart Foundry for the effects to take place.

*Note: Each oracle class feat from this module has the (MR)Oracle trait. When adding class feats for this oracle class in the character builder, simply filter the
traits by (MR)Oracle, and only the MROracle class feats will populate.*
